# Viruses, Worms, Trojans, and other Malware

## Overview
Software installed on computers may have negative application to the user. It may not have been installed by the user intentionally.  We will explore various types of malicious software that is installed on computers, how it works, and how to prevent it.

## Purpose
Malicious software is often used to capture information from users, erase or steal data, and even use a computer as a part of a larger botnet army. Students should learn what happens when this type of software is installed, how it is installed with or without the user's knowledge, and what can be done to prevent it.

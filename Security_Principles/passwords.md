# Password Selection

## Overview
Students will learn about good practices in selecting passwords, the dangers of weak passwords or sharing passwords between sites, and how to use password managers.

## Purpose
Passwords are the way we access the majority of our information and online accounts. The passwords we use are often weak in a way that would allow hackers to guess them or we use the same password on multiple accounts.  If one of those accounts is compromised, then our password to other sites is exposed.

Best practices in password selection include selecting a different password for each account and ensuring that the password is sufficiently difficult for a hacker to guess or bruteforce attack.

### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Identify best practices in password selection.
- Use a password manager for management of the multiple passwords.
- Identify good and bad passwords.

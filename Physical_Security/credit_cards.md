# Credit Cards & Payment Methods

TODO:
- Need assessment questions
- Extended learning RaspPI bitcoin miner could be better

## Overview
Payment methods are increasingly digital and the security of the transaction varies depending on the card type and the merchant's ability to secure their data.  In this lesson we will look at the security of different payment methods, how credit card data is stolen, and methods being used to increase security.

# Introduction & Ethics

## Overview
Cyber Security is an increasingly in-demand field of Computer Science. In this course we will look at the major ideas in the fields of Cyber Security or Information Assurance. This is not a "hacking" class but we are looking at the ways that computers, programs, networks, and people are exploited by hackers and what we can do to prevent or minimize the damage caused by bad actors.


## Purpose
This activity will give students an opportunity to learn about a major hacking event in-depth and share with the class. This also serves as a way to get students in the class to speak and contribute to the discussion.  

As a class looking at how computers are exploited, we will be learning a lot of skills that could be used to access someone's computer or network without their permission.  While all of these skills are easily learned on the Internet, it is important that we agree to respect private property and never access something without permission.


### Objectives
#### Students will be able to:
- Discuss ethical behavior in online context
- Ethical dilemma, gray areas
- Identify Ten Commandments of Cyber Ethics
- Describe a major hacking event
- Identify the vulnerability that led to the attacks
- Suggest ways to prevent similar attacks

### Preparation
- [x] Students will need access to the internet
- [x] Printed copies of the ethics statement [.docx](docs/ETHICS_STATEMENT.docx)

### Links
- For the Teacher

- For the Students
	- [Ten Commandments of Cyber Ethics](http://cybercitizenship.org/ethics/commandments.html)

### Vocabulary

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started
Class introductions
Cyber Security overview
Ethics Statement
> Students need to understand that the material learned in this class
> should not be used to access files, networks, or other property that they
> do not have permission to access.  Lack of security does not imply permission.

### Activity
Look at several scenarios about ethical situations
- What would you do?
- Did the people involved act ethically?
- Who was harmed in this interaction, who is the victim?

Have students look at "Ten Commandments of Cyber Ethics"
- Students will pair up and each take one commandment.  
	- Create an example and non-example of this commandment.
	- Present to the class

Re-evaluate opening scenarios and describe why the ethical response is or is not appropriate.  
- Link the behavior back to ten commandments.

### Activity
In pairs, research one of the major hacking events of the past several years.
In your research, identify several important ideas:
- Who was attacked?
- Who was the attacker (or who is thought to be if unclear)?
- What was the motive (money, political, warfare, prank)
- What was the result of the attack?
- How can this type of attack be prevented in the future?

Compile this information into a presentation for the class.


Major Hacking Events:
- 2014 - Mt. Gox
- 2011 - Bank of America, Turkish Hacker
- 2010 - Stuxnet
- 2011 - Sesame Street YouTube channel
- 2014 - PSN hacked at christmas time
- 2014 - Sony Pictures Hacked
- 2013 - Target Credit cards hacked
- 2014 - Home Depot Hacked
- 2014 – Heartbleed Bug
- 2015 - IRS hacked
- 2015 - Jeep Hacked
- 2014 - Apple iCloud hacked
- 2017 – WannaCry Ransomware

### Wrap-up
- Discussion of hacking events
- Hackers gain a detailed knowledge of a computer or system then find  vulnerabilities.  
> Thinking of your own house, could you get in if you didn't have a key?
> What inside knowledge do you have of your own home that would allow access?  
> What could you change to strengthen your home-security?
> Would the additional security be a benefit or a hindrance?  For example, 10 locks would make your door more secure but would also limit your own access in a speedy way.

### Assessment Questions
- Brainstorm ways to keep yourself safe online.
- What are some methods hackers use to gain unauthorized access to a computer or network?
- What can we do as individuals to prevent this?
- What should companies or governments do about hacking?

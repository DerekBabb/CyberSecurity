# Steganography

## Overview
Students will learn about and engage with steganography techniques and software.

## Purpose
Images and other media can be used to hide information "in plain sight".  While the image is visible to anyone on the web, the secret message is only visible to those who know it's there and how to read it.

## Teaching Guide
### Getting Started:
Pixelation - Code.org
- https://studio.code.org/s/pixelation
Steganography video - Computerphile:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWEXCYQKyDc

### Activity:
Manual Steganography
Use the pixelation widget at Code.org to make a Favicon.
- The icon should be 16 x 16.
- Use 24-bits of color data per pixel.

Once the image is created, use the least significant bit of each red, green, and blue channel to hide a message.

The data from your message should be spread across all of the RGB pixels in your Favicon.

### Activity:
Use several available Steganography tools and compare:
